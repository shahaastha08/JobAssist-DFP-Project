# JobAssist-DFP-Project
JobAssist is an aggregating tool that allows users to get information about a particular job role and company from multiple sources using the LinkedIn listing of that job. It uses four data sources, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed and Google Books. This project was done as a part of the Data Focus Python Course taken at Carnegie Mellon University
